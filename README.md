If your PC hardware is similar to mine, you can try this entire collecion. But you may still need some tweaks to make it work for you.  

### The drivers in this repo have all been customized! If there is a same file in S/L/E, REPLACE it!  

### Notice:
 - Configuring Hackintosh on PC need far more time than configuring Linux, So **Keep Patient**.
 - AMD CPU Users usually have little luck on Hackintosh
 - **DSDT injection may not work on a different hardware**, please use with caution
 - Even if your laptop is exactly same as mine, you are still likely to fail on boot.
 - You need to download Nvidia Web Driver from nvidia if you are using dedicated graphics card.
 - This repo is large, so **'Download ZIP' is recommended.**
 - Hackintosh is just a technical proof of my understanding of macOS and Unix, and
 - **I will not take any responsibility for any data loss or hardware damage caused by this collection.**
